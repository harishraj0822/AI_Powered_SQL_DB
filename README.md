Project Title: AI-Powered SQL â€” Natural Language Interface to SQL Database 

Summary: AI-Powered SQL is an interface that allows users to interact with a MySQL database using plain English prompts. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 model to convert natural language queries into optimized SQL statements, execute them on the database, and return results in a user-friendly UI. This eliminates the need for end users to know SQL, making data more accessible to non-technical teams.
